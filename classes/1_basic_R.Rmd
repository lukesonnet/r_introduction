```

Much of this course comes from materials created by [Tyler Reny](http://tylerreny.github.io/).

## What is this?

This is an RMarkdown document. It is a way to include code and text in the same document. How these files will look is like the following:

Here's some text explaining the problem and what we are going to do.

```{r}
# This is an R chunk with some code
x <- 3 + 4
x
```

Most of the time, you will work in an RMarkdown document or in a .R script, which is similar to a .do file, for those of you familiar with Stata.

## Why R?

* R is free, and open-source
* R is a comprehensive, extensible programming language
* R has a large ecosystem of useful packages
* R is functional, replicable, and integrates well with modern workflows
* R is used by political scientists, economists, sociologists, psychologists, and many in the biological sciences; it is also one of the main languages used by statisticians
* R is flexible

## Packages

For each major version of R (3.4, 3.5, etc.) you need to install a series of packages that greatly enhance the usability of R. Let's look at how we interact with packages.

```{r, eval=1}
# what is loaded?
search()

# how do you install new packages?
install.packages('lubridate')

# what is downloaded and available to be used?
library(lubridate)
```

## Working directories

You can find your current working directory a couple of ways. In your Console window it is listed, and you can also get it programmatically.

```{r}
getwd()

# you can always set it for the current session
setwd("~/Dropbox/teaching/lums_R")

#list files in your current working directory
list.files()
```

In general, it's a good idea to try and work in some root folder for an entire project, and then define all paths relative to that folder. My preferred way to do this is through R Projects. Let's show you how to create one.

If you work on scripts in a project, every working directory is set to the project directory, and then all paths are relative to that root directory.

## Basic commands

R is a programming language that has fairly complete functionality, although it is designed specifically for statistical analysis. Unlike Stata, where you work primarily with one focal data matrix and maybe some other auxiliary data, everything in R is an "object", meaning it has a name and refers to a specific data matrix, vector, number, function, or more complicated object.

```{r}
5 + 6 # addition
9 - 3 # subtraction
6 / 10 # division
5 * 8 # multiplication
5^2 # exponentiation
sqrt(25) # square roots
abs(-23) # absolute values
# much more...
```

In R you will mostly want to be saving your work in objects that you use in later analysis or for output to files.

- `<-` is an assignment operator, some use `=` but that is less frequent
- on the left if the variable name of the object where I am storing things
- to the right is whatever I want to put into my object

```{r}
x <- 5 - 4
x
```

**Exercise:** Create a variable called `y` and store in it the square root of 4.

```{r}
```

Let's create a simple vector!

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
x
```

What was that `c()` function used `x` object? Simply it's the combine function that is used all the time in R to create vectors and other objects.

We can always inspect an object with the `str()` function. This is a super helpful function I use all the time to check out what I'm working with.

```{r}
str(x)
```

## Getting help

Getting help in R is super important. You need to learn carefully how to use the help file, and also how to use the internet to find solutions to problems you will encounter.

```{r}
?c
?str
```

Let's show an example of when you might need to debug a problem when creating a sum of a vector.

```{r}
z <- c('1', '2', '3')
z
sum(z)
```

What does this error message tell you?

What does `sum()` expect?

```{r}
?sum
str(z)
```

**Exercise**: Use the `as.numeric()` function to change the `z` object to a numeric vector and then save the sum as `z_num`. Look at the `?as.numeric` help if you aren't sure how to use it!

```{r}
```

## Different kinds of vectors

There are four main kinds of vectors you'll be working with. Numbers (which is both "numeric" and "integer"), letters ("character"), true/false ("logical", also called boolean in other languages), and "factors". Let me briefly introduce them all here.

```{r}
# numeric
x <- c(1.1, 0.3, 4.4)
class(x)
str(x)
x/3

# integer
x <- c(1L, 2L, 3L)
class(x)
x <- 1:3
class(x)
str(x)
x/3
str(x/3)

# character
x <- c("a", "b", "87")
class(x)
str(x)
x/3

# logical
x <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
class(x)
str(x)
x/3 # huh?

# the fact that R will often treat FALSE as 0 and TRUE as 1
# when needed is very handy in _many_ instances
x <- c("a", "b", "a")
x
# Say we want to count the number of "a"s in this vector
# we can use table
table(x)
# or we can sum the number of times there is an "a"
x == "a"
sum(x == "a")

# factor
x <- factor(c("a", "b", "a"))
x
class(x)
str(x)
levels(x)
is.ordered(x) # can add order using `levels=` argument
```

## More work with numbers and vectors

Let's create a couple of objects and see how we can interact with them!

```{r}
x <- 5
x
y <- 10
y
z <- x + y
z
```

There a couple of different ways we can create numeric vectors, especially when they are sequences.

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
y <- 1:3
z <- seq(1, 3, by = 1)
x
y
z
```

These all look similar, but what's different about them? Any one notice?

The key difference between R and other languages and statistical software is its strong reliance on "vectorization" which refers to the idea that R will apply some functions to each element of a vector rather than the entire vector. This idea won't be foreign to those of you used to Stata.

Let's see some useful ways this can be used.

```{r}
a_vector <- c(-3.2, 1.3, 0.1)
a_number <- 2.7

a_vector + a_number
```

When you apply the `+` function to a function and a number, it is going to add that number to all of the elements in the vector. Essentially it is applying the addition to each element in the vector.

Many functions that apply to individual elements of a vector are automatically "vectorized".

```{r}
a_vector^2
sqrt(a_vector)
```

If you add two vectors together that are the same length, it proceeds element-wise.

```{r}
a_second_vector <- c(1.0, 2.3, 0.3)
a_vector + a_second_vector
```

```{r}
length(a_vector)
length(a_second_vector)
```

What if you have two vectors of different lengths?

```{r}
a_short_vector <- c(-1, 1)
length(a_short_vector)

a_vector
a_short_vector + a_vector # recycling with warning

a_long_vector <- 1:4
a_long_vector + a_short_vector # recycling without warning
```

What you see here is recycling, where it just repeats the shorter vector so that it can apply the operation to the longer vector. This is often very useful, but it can also cause problems. Pay attention to warnings and always pay attention to the size of objects you are working with! It will only warn if the lengths are not multiples of each other. If they are, it will silently recycle.

There are also a bunch of functions we can apply to a vector besides `length`.

```{r}
# functions that provide metadata about your object
length(a_vector)
str(a_vector)
class(a_vector)
summarize(a_vector)

# functions that summarize your object in one number
sum(a_vector)
mean(a_vector)
median(a_vector)
max(a_vector)
min(a_vector)

# functions that keep your object the same length but apply a function
# to each element (vectorized)
abs(a_vector)
sqrt(a_vector)
a_vector^2
as.character(a_vector)
```

You can also "name" most things in R by doing something like this:

```{r}
names(a_vector) # Does it have existing names?
names(a_vector) <- c("value 1", "ValEU $22", "value 3")
a_vector
class(a_vector)
str(a_vector)
attr(a_vector, "names")
names(a_vector)
```

**Exercise:** Create a vector of four numbers using the `c()` and store it in a variable. Create a second vector of four numbers and store it in a variable. Add the two vectors together and take the `sum()` of the added vector.

```{r}
```

## Special values

One more crucial thing to introduce is some special values, such as the `NA` value.

The `NA` value is similar to `.` in Stata; it represents missing data. It isn't like `.` in that it isn't stored as some negative infinite value and it is not automatically ignored by many functions in R. Let's take a look at the following function.

```{r}
na_vector <- c(1.3, NA, -0.4)
na_vector
is.na(na_vector)
mean(na_vector)
```

**Exercise**: Use the above `na_vector` vector and use the `mean()` functino to get the mean of `na_vector`, ignoring the missing value. Use the `?mean` help.

```{r}
```

There are several other special values you may see:

```{r}
x <- NA
class(x)
is.na(x)
# There are different "kinds" of NAs
x <- NA_real_
x
class(x) # numeric

x <- NA_character_
x
class(x) # character

# No value at all
NULL
x <- NULL
x

x <- numeric(0) # no value, but very different!
x

# Other special (non-)numbers
NaN
Inf
-Inf
1/0
-1/0
log(-1)
sqrt(-1)
?is.nan
?is.infinite
```

## Subsetting and indexing

There are *many* ways to subset a vector. Let's review the major ways!

First way is you can use position indexing. Unlike many other programming languages, R starts at 1 rather than 0. To get the first element out of `na_vector` we can do the following.

```{r}
na_vector
na_vector[1]
na_vector[2]
na_vector[3]
```

We can also select several elements at a time using a vector of indices:

```{r}
na_vector
na_vector[c(1, 3)]

i_vec <- c(1, 3)
na_vector[i_vec]
```

We can also do "boolean" subsetting, where we create a logical vector that is the same length as the object to draw out the TRUE objects. This is a really helpful feature.

```{r}
l_vec <- c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)
na_vector
na_vector[l_vec]

na_vector > 0
na_vector[na_vector > 0]

is.na(na_vector)
!is.na(na_vector)
na_vector[!is.na(na_vector)]
```

You can also use names if your vector is named!
```{r}
names(na_vector) <- c('first_val', 'missing', 'second_val')
na_vector['second_val']
na_vector['bad_label']
```

But what about that above "NA" element in the logical subsetting vector? This is some peculiar behavior. When you subset using an NA, it doesn't just pull out that value, it actually just returns NA in that position.

```{r}
na_vector
na_vector[c(NA, NA, TRUE)]
na_vector[c(NA, TRUE, TRUE)]
```

**Exercise:** Create a numeric vector using the `c()` function of length 4. Add the first two elements of the vector to the last two elements of the vector.

```{r}
```

## Matrices

I'm only going to do a brief introduction to matrices, as I want to move on to the main data structures you'll be using.

Let's use the `matrix` function to create a basic matrix

```{r}
mat <- matrix(1:4, nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
mat
mat2 <- matrix(1:4, nrow = 2, ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)
mat2
mat3 <- matrix(1:4, nrow = 2, dimnames = list(c("a", "b"), c("A", "B")))
mat3
rownames(mat3)
colnames(mat3)
```

Subsetting and much of the basic math works as you would expect:

```{r}
mat
mat[1, 2]
mat[c(1, 2), 1]
mat[, 1]
mat[1, ]
mat[2, ]
mat[c(TRUE, FALSE), c(TRUE, TRUE)]
mat3["a", "A"]

# element-wise broadcasting of functions
mat + mat2
mat / mat2
mat^2
sqrt(mat)
abs(mat)
sign(mat)

# summarizes entire matrix
mean(mat)
sum(mat)
nrow(mat)
ncol(mat)

# matrix multiplication
mat %*% mat2
t(mat) %*% mat2 # transpose!
crossprod(mat, mat2)
tcrossprod(mat, mat2)
```

Now, if we want to apply a function to each row or each column of our matrix, it is pretty simple. We can use the `apply` method! The 1st MARGIN is the rows, and the 2nd MARGIN is the columns.

```{r}
?apply
mat3
apply(mat3, 1, mean)
apply(mat3, 2, mean)
apply(mat3, 1, sum)
apply(mat3, 2, sum)

# You can pass other arguments two ways
apply(mat3, 1, sum, na.rm = TRUE)
apply(mat3, 1, function(x) sum(x, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Sometimes there are dedicated functions for these occasions.

```{r}
rowMeans(mat3)
colMeans(mat3)
rowSums(mat3)
colSums(mat3)
```

We can also append matrices using `rbind` or `cbind`.

```{r}
cbind(mat, mat2)
rbind(mat, mat2)
```

**Exercise:** Create a matrix with 3 rows and 2 columns with some numbers you made up and matrix multiply it by another matrix with 2 rows and 3 columns. Get the mean of each column of the resulting matrix any way you want.

```{r}
```

## Creating and sampling data

There are many ways to create fake data. Mostly we have just generated vectors using the `1:n` syntax or using the combine function `c(1.0, -1, 3)`. Now I'll cover more statistically grounded ways to generate data. First, you can draw data from a wide range of distributions.

First let's look at the help-file for `rnorm()`.

```{r}
rnorm(n = 4)
rnorm(n = 4, mean = 2, sd = 3)
rpois(n = 4, lambda = 20)
rbinom(n = 4, size = 3, prob = 0.3)
rbinom(n = 4, size = 1, prob = 0.5)
rbeta(n = 4, shape1 = 1, shape2 = 3.4)
```

**Exercise:** Use `runif` to draw 10 numbers from a continuous uniform distribution ranging from 3 to 4.

```{r}
?runif
```

Another useful function is `sample`. It can be used many ways. Let's explore some of them.

```{r}
sample(3) # if given an integer, just randomly orders a sequence starting at 1
sample(c(1.0, -3.2, 4.1)) # if given a vector, it randomly orders it
sample(1:10, replace = TRUE) # can sample with replacement, defaults to same size vector
sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), size = 10, replace = TRUE) # can sample with replacement, different size vector
sample(1:3, size = 10, replace = FALSE) # What does this error mean?
```

Often we can use sample to conveniently get a bunch of coin tosses for randomization and the like.

```{r}
sample(0:1, size = 20, replace = TRUE)
rep(0:1, each = 10)
sample(rep(0:1, each = 10))
```

## data.frames

`data.frames` are the main data structure you will directly interface with in R. `data.frames` are simply lists, which I'll introduce to you now.

Lists are an object that contain a series of named or unnamed other objects. Unlike a vector or a matrix, the items in the list need not be of the same type.

```{r}
wallet <- list(
  credit_cards = c("visa", "master_card"),
  rupees = 6240,
  other_currency = c("dollars" = 60, "euros" = 50)
)
wallet
str(wallet)
names(wallet)
length(wallet)
```

There are also two new ways to subset a list. First, we can use the double bracket, `[[`. With lists, a single bracket could allow us to get one or two things, and it will always return a list. Double brackets only get us one thing from the list, but they return that object as itself, not as a subset of the list.

```{r}
wallet[1]
wallet[1:2]
str(wallet[1])
wallet[[1]]
str(wallet[[1]])
wallet["rupees"]
wallet[["rupees"]]
```

You can now also use the `$` operator to get a variable by name from a list or a data.frame.

```{r}
wallet$rupees
```

So a data.frame is just a list, where each variable is an object in the list, and all variables in the list must be the same length. This is the data matrix you're familiar with from Stata.

```{r}
dat <- data.frame(
  x = rnorm(10),
  y = rnorm(10),
  z = letters[1:10]
)
dat
head(dat)
str(dat)
nrow(dat)
ncol(dat)
names(dat)
colnames(dat)
rownames(dat)

View(dat)
dat["x"]
str(dat["x"])
dat[["x"]]
dat[, "x"]
str(dat[["x"]])
dat$x
str(dat$x)
```

A function I love for categorical variables is the `table()` function, which just tabulates variables.

```{r}
table(dat$z)

# Cross-tab whether X is negative with z
dat$negative_x <- dat$x < 0
table(dat$z, dat$negative_x)
```

You'll notice `z` is a factor. We'll talk more about that later, but it's like a labeled variable in Stata, where there is some text label for some numeric values that show up in the data. This happens when you use base R data.frame constructors and character vectors. When we get to the tidyverse we will often avoid factors. Let's recreate the data but without `z` as a factor. Note, we can also use vectors we've created earlier.

```{r}
x_vec <- rnorm(10)
dat <- data.frame(
  x = x_vec,
  y = rnorm(10),
  z = letters[1:10],
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
?data.frame
```

Subsetting data.frames works a lot like subsetting matrices. There are many options:

```{r}
dat[1:3, ]
dat[3:4, c("x", "z")]
dat[3:4, 1:2]
dat[, 1:2]

samp_id <- sample(nrow(dat), size = 5)
samp_id
dat[samp_id, ]
# Also can directly sample
dat[sample(nrow(dat), size = 5), ]
dat[dat$x > 0, ]
dat[dat$z == "a", ]
# Also can use subset
subset(dat, x > 0)
subset(dat, z == "a")
```

You can edit columns of a data.frame just as you would an individual vector.

```{r}
dat$x_y <- dat$x + dat$y
head(dat)
```

We'll manipulate data.frames more tomorrow using the `tidyverse`. Let's just load it here to use some convenience functions.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
glimpse(dat)
# Also a function to make sampling easier
samp_id <- sample_n(dat, size = 5)
samp_id
```

## files and reading files

Let's read in our first file! Most of the time in R and in general I like to work with `.csv` files. These are Comma-Separated Value files. They are simple plain text files that have no bells and whistles, just raw data that can easily be read by many pieces of software.

```{r}
?read.csv
dat <- read.csv("data/qog/qog_crossec.csv")
str(dat) # hmmm

dat2 <- read.csv("data/qog/qog_crossec.csv", sep = ";", dec = ",")
dat2[1:5, 1:5]
#str(dat2)

dat <- read.csv2("data/qog/qog_crossec.csv")
dat[1:5, 1:5]
# Can also remove factors
dat <- read.csv2("data/qog/qog_crossec.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
dat[1:5, 1:5]

# Tidyverse (faster, automatically no factors)
dat <- read_csv("data/qog/qog_crossec.csv") # same problem
dat <- read_csv2("data/qog/qog_crossec.csv")
dat[1:5, 1:5]
class(dat)
```

**Exercise:** Read the csv at this url ("https://keybase.pub/hrbrmstr/data/mtcars.csv") and get the average miles per gallon (`mpg`) overall. Then subset to each each number of cylinders (`cyl`) and get the average miles per gallon of each cylinder.

```{r}
```

We can also use the `haven` package which to easily read Stata .dta files.

```{r}
library(haven)
dat <- read_dta("data/PSLM 2013-14/PSLM+_Stata+12+format_.dta")
head(dat)
glimpse(dat)

# check labels
attributes(dat$s2aq01)$label
```

## Exercise 1

1. Create a character vector of length 3 filled in with any values you want.
2. Create a vector of length 100 sampling from the above vector. `sample()` command.
3. Create a data.frame with 100 rows. One column should be the letters you've created above. Then create three more numeric columns using three of the random number generators we dicussed above (e.g. `rnorm`).
4. Using either regular `[` subsetting or using the `subset()` function, calculate the mean of each of these three numeric columns *for each value of the initial character vector you created.*


## Exercise 2

1. Load a dataset of the 2018 Pakistani General election results in to a data.frame: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/colincookman/pakistan_election_results_2018/master/pk_constituency_data_2018.csv
2. Look at summaries of average winners by party, province, district; what summaries can you think of? Hint: remember we can count how often something happens by creating a boolean vector (e.g. `dat$winner == 1` and the summing the TRUE values in that vector).
